# 2048-Game

The rules of how to play 2048 are simple. You have four ways to move the tiles: left, right, up, and down. You combine numbers like 2 and 2 to make a 4 tile, 4 and 4 to make an 8 tile, and so on and so forth.

A low number such as a 2 or 4 will appear in a random spot with every move you make. This makes the board fill up faster, and the rows more difficult to move as the game goes on. 

How To Win 2048
Organize
The most important thing in your 2048 strategy is to stay organized. If you are randomly swapping numbers in the game, you won't get very far in the chaos. Try and keep the biggest numbers on one side of the square, that way you can start trying to shift them all into a corner. This is one of the most important keys of how to win 2048. 

Think Ahead
You know that a random number will appear on an empty space on a tile. So make sure you're sliding your tiles in a way, so you can control the empty space in which the tile will appear

Keep It Cornered
An easy way to beat the game is to keep your largest number in a corner. The way to do this is to keep the row or column filled with other numbers. 

This guarantees it will not move while you move around the other numbers. It also guarantees that your largest number won't be lost in the middle of the board, making it harder to add to as the game goes on.

Less Is More

Build Chains
It is easy to start recognizing a pattern in 2048 and you can use those patterns to your advantage. If you know what directions you are utilizing, you can build a chain. The most popular chain is a snake chain formation.

A chain is a way to keep your smaller numbers on one side of the board and larger numbers on the other. Ideally, the larger numbers will be closer to the largest number in order to easily build it up. This is similar to the way that players should try to keep the larger fruits on one side and the smaller fruits on the other side in Suika Watermelon Game.
